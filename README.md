# Noggin is a tool to help your Noggin :)

Noggin is a simple tool that can help to save snippets of information. Think of it as a notepad, but with the benefit of being able to quickly save and find your little snippets or Noggins.It is pretty straightforward to use. 

You start by clicking New and creating a name.

Select from the left panel to load your Noggin over here in the right.

Type what you want to keep and click save.

You can also rename and delete your noggins.

Finally, the filter at the bottom left can be used to find any of your previous noggin entries. Providing you were sensible enough to give it a name that makes sense.
